# Image Uploader API

This is a small API that uploads images to Imgur. The function of `ImageAPICall` is adapted by the Go functions provided by Imgur in their [API docs](https://apidocs.imgur.com/).

This service is dockerized, so in order to run it, you'll need an access token. In order to generate one, you can look into [Authorization and OAuth](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#authorization-and-oauth) in Imgur's API docs. Once you have the token, you can set it up as an environment variable and utilize it as an argument while running the container.

You can run the container in the following manner:
```Go
export ACCESS_TOKEN=token
docker build --build-arg ACCESS_TOKEN=$ACCESS_TOKEN -t image-service:0.0.1 .
docker run -p 8000:8000 image-service:0.0.1 
```

You should see a `Starting Server` output to know it has successfully started, and you should be able to make requests to `localhost:8000` if you're running locally.
